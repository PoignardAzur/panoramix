# `misc_docs/` folder

This is a semi-structured bunch of documentation files, that I don't know where to put yet.

- **compiler_errors.md:** List of interesting compiler errors that a beginner probably wouldn't know how to interpret. The idea is to add new errors to provide data for a potential effort to make the crate more idiot-proof somehow. File is probably out of date.
- **reconciliation.md:** Short high-level overview of what reconciliation is and how it works.
